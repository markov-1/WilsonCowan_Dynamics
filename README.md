# WilsonCowan_Dynamics

This are the codes for simulating dynamical activity in a macaque brain network, using the WIlson-Cowan Model. 

Objective: 
Observe patterns of activity (synchronisation, persistent activity) with changes to params (weights, number of connections, structural changes in network).
